        Yet another page that was inspired by Wes Bos (and Scott Tolinski). Recs
        includes all of the gadgets, tools, and services that I uwould recommend
        to my family and friends. The list of things I've learned from random
        people on the internet is long, so why not share the things I love with
        others?
