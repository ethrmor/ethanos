        always be. Feel free to check back periodically for updates!

            I bought this new in 2019 and have regretted it ever since. I plan
            on upgrading to a 2023 15" M2 MacBook Air by the end of the year.

          Logitech MX Mechanical Mini for Mac Keyboard
          <p className='pt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300'>
            I've always been a fan mechanical keyboards, but I hated the loud,
            obnoxious ones, which I know is a bit of an oxymoron. I recently
            upgraded to the Logitech MX Mechanical as I've used their MX mouse
            for years.

            You'll notice a trend that I really enjoy Logitech products. This
            may be due to the fact that I have not tried out many alternatives,
            because I have been so happy since the start. The quality is so nice
            and, in my experience, their products last much longer than many
            electronics today.
